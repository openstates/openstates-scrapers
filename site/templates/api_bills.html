<h2> Bill API </h2>

{% rest %}

Two API methods are available for working with bills:

`Bill Search`_
    Allows looking up bills by (almost) any of their attributes.  Only returns basic information about a bill.
`Bill Lookup`_
    Lookup full details on a bill by id (including all actions, sponsors, votes, etc.)

Both methods return bill objects with the following fields (in the case of search, a subset of these fields).

Bill Search
===========

Search bills, either by keyword or by properties such as updated date or session.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

When searching either a keyword (``q``) parameter is required or a ``state`` and ``session``.
All other parameters are optional and can be combined as needed.

``q``
    the keyword string to lookup
``state``
    filter results by given state (two-letter abbreviation)
``search_window``
    a string representing what time period to search across. Pass 'session'
    to search bills from the state's current or most recent legislative session,
    'term' to search the current or most recent term, 'all' to search as far back
    as the Open State Project has data for, or supply 'session:SESSION_NAME' or
    'term:TERM_NAME' (e.g. 'session:2009' or 'term:2009-2010') to search a
    specific session or term.
``chamber``
    filter results by given chamber ('upper' or 'lower')
``updated_since``
    only return bills that have been updated since a given date, YYYY-MM-DD format
``subject``
    filter by bills that are about a given subject. If multiple subject
    parameters are supplied then only bills that match all of them
    will be returned. See `list of subjects <http://openstates.sunlightlabs.com/categorization/#subjects>`_
``sponsor_id``
    only return bills sponsored by the legislator with the given id (corresponds to `leg_id`)

Bill Lookup
===========

This endpoint exists to get all information about a bill given its state/session/chamber and bill id.

`http://openstates.sunlightlabs.com/api/v1/bills/{STATE-ABBREV}/{SESSION}/{BILL-ID}h?apikey={YOUR_API_KEY}`

alternatively, if BILL-ID is ambiguous, chamber may be prepended as part of the path:

`http://openstates.sunlightlabs.com/api/v1/bills/{STATE-ABBREV}/{SESSION}/{CHAMBER}/{BILL-ID}h?apikey={YOUR_API_KEY}`

Example
