This USB drive contains a recent build of all necessary resources to run Open States scrapers, so that you don't need to wait for them to download.

Prerequisites:

- Git
- Docker

## Copy the Open States repository to your machine

Copy the \`openstates\` directory to your local machine's storage. This is a full Git repository, and is ready for you to commit new changes.

## Load the Docker images

Make the Docker images available on your local machine using:

\`\`\`bash
for f in ${drivepath}/docker-images/*.gz; do
	docker load --input \"\${f}\"
done
\`\`\`

Now you can continue with the [Getting Started documentation](http://docs.openstates.org/en/latest/contributing/getting-started.html) as if you had just finished running \`docker-compose build openstates\`.

## Read the documentation

The documentation [is available online](http://docs.openstates.org), but is also on this drive. Simply open \`./documentation/_build/html/index.html\` in a web browser.
