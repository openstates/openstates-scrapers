        TLDR: throw out bad text, replace it using different parser
        settings.

        When using `pdftotext` on the 2015 House committee list,
        the second and third columns of the second page get mixed up,
        which makes it very difficult to parse. Adding the `--layout`
        option fixes this, but isn't worth switching all parsing to
        that since the standard `pdftotext --nolayout` is easier in all
        other cases.

        The best solution to this is to throw out the offending text,
        and replace it with the correct text. The third and fourth
        columns are joint comittees that are scraped from the Senate
        document, so the only column that needs to be inserted this way
        is the second.
