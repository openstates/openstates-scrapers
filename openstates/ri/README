(Note: a POST with a comma delimited list of bill numbers passed as the 'hListBills' form
parameter to the following URL provides information on bills)

legislators.py
--------------
Progress: finished
Data scraped:
  * term
  * chamber
  * district_name
  * full_name
  * party
  * office_address
  * town_represented (comma delimited list of towns)
  * email

Notes: The source information does not provide separate first/last name information, so only
full name is scraped.


committees.py
-------------
Progress: finished
Data scraped:
  * chamber
  * membernames
  * roles

Notes: It seems like the committee links from http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/Sitemap.html are
intermittently timing-out. There is a try/except clause to handle these timeouts.


bills.py
--------
Progress: some
Implementation plan: Currently, bills are requested one at a time and the results are parsed
for the relevant data. It would potentially be quicker to request multiple bill details all at
once, but there is a difficulty in that the list of bills contains bills with irregular IDs
(they end with letters, e.g. 5002Aaa) which would need to be removed (the request page only
accepts numerical bill IDs). Additionally, bill actions are present in the results, but they
are currently not parsed. For vote information, the plan is to look into the House and Senate
Journals for the relevant days to get the roll call. Unfortunately, the journals are only
available as PDFs.
Data scraped:
  * session
  * chamber
  * bill_id
  * title
  * type
  * sponsors and cosponsors

Note: Currently, a try/except clause handles irregular bill IDs. It would be better to exclude
these before sending the POST request.
