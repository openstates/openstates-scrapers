"""
Minnesota legislative data can be found at the Office of the Revisor
of Statutes:
https://www.revisor.mn.gov/

Votes:
There are not detailed vote data for Senate votes, simply yes and no counts.
Bill pages have vote counts and links to House details, so it makes more
sense to get vote data from the bill pages.
