# In different sessions of the Illinois legislature, the same
# committee can have different names appear on http://ilga.gov/
# Sometimes this is just spelling of typographic, ("Agriculture &
# Conservation" vs "Agriculture and Conservation"). Sometimes the
# difference is larger. The COMMITTEES dictionary can be used for
# resolving these different names to to the same committee.  The keys
# of COMMITTEE are a tuple of the 'Name' and 'Code' of the committee
# as they appear on http://ilga.gov/senate/committees/default.asp or
# http://ilga.gov/house/committees/default.asp. The values are arbitrary ints, used only
# within the scraper as a unique identifier for the actual committee.

# HIGHEST ID POSSIBLY IN USE: 1132
