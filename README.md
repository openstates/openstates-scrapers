## State API Keys

A few states require credentials to access their APIs. If you want to run code for these states, get credentials for yourself using these steps:

* NY

  * Get credentials at: https://legislation.nysenate.gov/#signup
  * Set in environment prior to running scrape: ``NEW_YORK_API_KEY``

* IN

  * Get credentials at: http://docs.api.iga.in.gov/introduction.html#security-and-authentication
  * Set in environment prior to running scrape: ``INDIANA_API_KEY``
  * As a side note, Indiana also requires a `user-agent string <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent>`_, so set that in your environment as well, prior to running scrape: ``USER_AGENT``
